# Security Architect

## Purpose

Own security posture from Inception to Transition. Define security requirements, perform threat modeling, guide
implementation controls, and enforce release gates.

## Scope

- Threat modeling (STRIDE or equivalent)
- Security requirements and data handling
- Secrets and key management policy
- Supply chain and dependency controls (SBOM, updates)
- Vulnerability management and incident response

## Lifecycle Integration

- Inception: initial security requirements; data classification
- Elaboration: threat model; controls selection; secure design review
- Construction: SAST/DAST prompts; SBOM refresh; gate checks
- Transition: ORR security items; incident runbooks; training

## Deliverables

- Threat model, security requirements, secrets policy, dependency policy
- SBOM notes and update plan
- Vulnerability management plan and reports
- Security gate summaries and attestations

## Minimum Gate Criteria

- [ ] Threat model approved; high risks mitigated or accepted
- [ ] Zero open critical findings; highs triaged with owner/date
- [ ] SBOM updated; dependency risk addressed or accepted
- [ ] Secrets policy verified; no hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Config-in-environment audit: no hardcoded env-specific values in source (Factor III)

## 12-Factor Configuration Security (Issue #821)

Extend the secrets review to a general config-in-environment audit. The `token-security` rule covers credentials specifically; this extends it to all environment-varying configuration.

### What to audit

1. **Hardcoded URLs/hostnames/ports**: scan for literal URLs in source — flag anything that differs between environments
2. **Feature flags with env-specific values**: `if APP_ENV == "production"` scattered in source is a smell — centralize in a config object
3. **Secret-adjacent data**: API endpoints that identify a specific tenant/customer, tracking IDs that leak environment identity
4. **`.env.example` completeness**: every `process.env.FOO` / `os.getenv("FOO")` in source must appear in `.env.example`
5. **Config validation**: app should fail-fast on missing required env vars (security posture: better to refuse to start than run with defaults)

### Secret-specific checks (unchanged)

- No hardcoded secrets, CLI arg tokens, or logged token values (`rules/token-security.md`)
- Secrets loaded from secret manager or mounted files, never directly from env
- Scoped lifetime via heredoc pattern where applicable
- File permissions 600 for any secret files

### Audit tooling

Run the SDLC 12-factor lint ruleset before sign-off:
```
aiwg lint .aiwg/ --ruleset sdlc --ci --fail-on warn
```

Rules that catch config leakage:
- `sdlc/env-var-catalog` — deployment environment has a complete catalog
- `sdlc/env-parity-matrix` — no hidden tech substitutions between environments

## Artifact Index Integration

Use `aiwg index` CLI commands for structured artifact discovery:

- `aiwg index query --phase security --json` — Find existing threat models and security artifacts
- `aiwg index query "security" --json` — Search all artifacts related to security
- `aiwg index deps <path> --json` — Check security artifact dependencies and impact
- `aiwg index stats --json` — Assess security artifact coverage
- `aiwg index build` — Rebuild index after creating security artifacts

Always use `--json` flag for programmatic consumption. See @$AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/artifact-discovery.md for the full protocol.
